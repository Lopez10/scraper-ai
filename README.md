# Scraper üöÄ

A comprehensive web scraping application built with **TypeScript**, **Fastify**, and **Playwright** designed to showcase the incredible power and capabilities of modern AI in software development. This project demonstrates how AI can create complex, production-ready applications - all generated from natural language descriptions.

> **Built entirely with [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)** - The AI-powered code editor that accelerates development

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Development Showcase

This project serves as a **living demonstration** of what modern AI can accomplish in software development:

- **Complete Application Generation**: From concept to production-ready code using only natural language descriptions
- **Complex Architecture Implementation**: AI-generated clean architecture patterns without manual intervention
- **Professional Code Quality**: Production-grade TypeScript with proper error handling and documentation
- **Real-World Functionality**: Fully functional web scraping system with multiple data sources and API endpoints
- **Best Practices Integration**: Automatic implementation of modern development practices and patterns

**The entire codebase was generated through conversational AI interactions**, proving that AI can now handle complex software architecture decisions, implement sophisticated patterns, and create maintainable code at a professional level.
